Hi, I'm Nicolas! I'm a senior project manager in Toronto with over 9 years of experience working on various projects across the automotive, aerospace, and tech sectors, delivering solutions that combine cutting-edge technology, design, and user experience. I'm passionate about innovation and technology!

I started my career in France where I was involved in some of the most ambitious and groundbreaking projects in the industry. I worked on the 1:1 scale replica of the Mars Curiosity Rover for the French Space Agency, which was displayed at the Paris Air Show and attracted worldwide attention. 

At Renault/Nissan, I worked on the new versions of the best-selling vehicles of the company (Clio, Captur) where I contributed to the development and testing of self-driving cars. Between Paris, California, and Texas, I deployed a project management software at Zodiac Aerospace (now Safran), which improved the efficiency and quality of the aerospace manufacturing process. In 2009, I launched a popular electronic music blog called Stop The Noise, which featured interviews, reviews, and playlists of the latest trends in the genre.

I then moved to Canada, where I worked as a vendor at Microsoft, leading all the digital projects that were used to support and amplify local campaigns and events across the country. 

I also worked at two digital agencies, one where I launched two digital products: a mobile app to help dealerships manage their inventory, and a web platform that allowed them to create and share personalized copy for specific make/model/features. At Versett, I worked on a wholesale pricing management application for the liquor distribution branch of the British Columbia government.
