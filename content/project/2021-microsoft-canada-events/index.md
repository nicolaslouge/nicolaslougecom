**Company:** Microsoft Canada

**Year:** 2021

**Location:** Toronto, Canada

At the end of 2020, a few days before Christmas, I joined Microsoft Canada as a vendor through Wunderman Thompson to lead and manage all the digital projects that are used to support and amplify local campaigns and events across Canada.

One of the big projects of 2021 was the transfer and complete revamp of the [Microsoft Canada Events website](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/sites/canada-events/) that was managed by another agency as it's one of the major and most strategic local websites of Microsoft Canada.

Using the latest Microsoft standards in design while ensuring the experience was accessible, responsive, and fully bilingual, I managed the development with the technical team (Service Delivery Hub) and the stakeholders of the Digital, Ops, and Program team and successfully launched the new version of the website in June 2021.
