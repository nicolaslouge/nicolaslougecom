**Company:** Hubnest

**Year:** 2018 - 2019

**Location:** Toronto, Canada

In 2018, I moved to Toronto, Ontario in Canada and started working for a digital agency called [Hubnest](https://www.hubnest.com/).

As a project manager, I was hired to manage client projects but also to manage the development and the launch of the first two products of Hubnest parent companyâ€™s new digital start-up in the automotive industry called Productive Formula. The first product is Dealer Lingo (a digital marketing assistant) and Carlyzer (an inventory management mobile application).

During my first week working on Dealer Lingo, I identified a massive flaw in the current architecture of the tool that would have prevented us deploying important features and would have set us back for months if it had remained undetected. Quickly after identifying and documenting it, I worked with the CEO and the development team to rebuild the entire architecture. I then planned and managed the roadmap, upcoming features and sprints, and delivered the beta version that was presented to FCA North America (Fiat Chrysler Automobiles).

**Dealer Lingo:**
- Project size: 9 people / $400k (CAD)
- Project length: 10 months
- Miro / Project / Excel / PowerPoint / Jira
