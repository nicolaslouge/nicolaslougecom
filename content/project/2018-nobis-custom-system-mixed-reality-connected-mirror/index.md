**Company:** Hubnest

**Years:** 2018 - 2019

**Location:** Toronto, Canada

[Nobis](https://nobis.com/) is a luxury clothing company known for their winter wear with a presence in over 40 countries.

Hubnest was approached by Nobis to discuss ways to improve the retail experience of their locations. The collaborative brainstorming resulted in several variations but ultimately decided to give shoppers the appearance of how the jacket would look in different elements. This promotes Nobis’ mantra of ‘Embrace The Elements’.

The process would be for customers to scan a tag, try on the jacket and the screen would walk the shopper through different weather conditions depending on the jacket features. The visual experience of the shopper wearing the jacket would see their reflection with different weather conditions cycling as though they are standing in snowfall, rain, and windy conditions.

To bring this vision alive, I managed the development and the launch of a digital mirror in one pilot store in downtown Toronto.

This digital experience allowed the customers to see how the jacket would look in different weather conditions and gave them details about the specific model they selected.
We created the mirror and the tablet application, the logic of all the jacket data, and the weather animations.
