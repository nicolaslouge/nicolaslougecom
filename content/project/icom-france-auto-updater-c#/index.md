**Company:** ICOM France

**Year:** 2012

In July 2012, I interned at [ICOM](https://www.icomjapan.com/) - a Japanese manufacturer of radio transmitting and receiving equipment - during the first year of my computer science Master’s degree.

Icom product line includes “equipment for radio amateurs, pilots, maritime applications, land mobile professional applications and radio scanner enthusiasts”.

In the Research and Development division (R&D) of the engineering department, I developed in two months a tool that was able to detect and automatically update any Icom desktop software that was installed on a client’s computer. The tool was developed in C# using Microsoft Visual Studio on Windows 7. Fun fact: the favicon of the tool, a black and red « i » representing the first letter of the Icom logo, was hand-drawn on a website called [favicon.cc](https://www.favicon.cc/) which still exist in 2021 and hasn’t changed one bit.

Impressed by quality of the work done in only two months, the CEO of the company came to my desk at the end of my internship to give me a gift and to thank me personally.
