**Company:** Renault Group

**Years:** 2014 - 2017

**Location:** Paris, France

I joined the [Renault Group](https://www.renaultgroup.com/en/) as a project manager in 2014 via the management consulting company MI-GSO.

During the first six months, I was in charge of monitoring a set of procurement and quality KPIs to make sure the projects were aligned with the project milestones and objectives. The procurement process (RFP, RFQ, LOI) was really important to track for projects that were closed to the end of the design phase and especially for vehicle projects were the DRAC was involved (joint venture with Renault and Dongfeng to sell vehicles in China).

In 2015, the Clio (BJA) and Captur (HJB) projects started to grow as they entered the design phase. The bar was high as they were the very first vehicles of the brand to have autonomous driving features. The project management office asked to me led the creation and implementation of a new cross-functional position for the engineering system department (DEA-S) that was in charge of the CMF-B platform (modular underbody that could be adapted to new models), the radar, cameras, dashboard, screens, and more. 

As the scope of the project was huge, so was the role and the impact with every department (Design, Engineering, Quality, PMO, Prototype) of the company. To understand all the dependencies with them, I had to meet and work with hundreds of people at Renault and Nissan. I lead a team of 10 consultants and we focused on integrating the project and the system parts schedules into a modified version of Planisware, creating and updating enhanced monitoring tools, project reports & dashboards, and on continuously improving existing and new KPIs and processes. 

The implementation was such a success on both projects that Renault's management decided to implement it on all vehicle projects of the brand.

**Renault Clio (XJA) + CMF-B platform:**
- Project size: 100+ people / 1+ billion euros
- Project length: 5+ years
- Excel (thousands of files) / VBA / PowerPoint / Planisware / Business Intelligence
