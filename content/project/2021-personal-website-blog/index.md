**Year:** 2021

**Location:** Toronto, Ontario

For the past few years, I read a lot about static site generators (SSG) and how easy and fast they were to easily create and launch a personal website.

At the end of 2021, I finally bought my domain name and started to play with Hugo and Netlify. After using Wordpress for more than a decade for my blogs projects, I really enjoyed setting up my personal website with a static site generator.

I'll extensively use the blog feature to talk about what I'm currently interested in or working on.

You can also find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nicolaslouge) where I'm talking about my #100DaysOfCode challenge.
